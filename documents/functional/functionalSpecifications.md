## I. Introduction

### 1. Glossary

| Terms used | Definition |
|---|---|
| Assembler | A program that translates assembly language into machine code. |
| Semantic Validity | Ensuring that the meaning of the assembly-like code is correct and adheres to the intended functionality. |
| Machine Code | The low-level code that is directly executed by the computer's central processing unit (CPU). |
| Virtual Processor | A virtual processor refers to a simulated or emulated instance of a central processing unit (CPU) that operates in a virtualized environment. It mimics the behaviour of a physical processor, allowing the execution of instructions and processing of data, often used for testing, development, or educational purposes. |
| C language | The C programming language is a general-purpose, procedural programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s. It is widely used for system and application software development due to its efficiency, portability, and powerful features. C serves as the foundation for many other programming languages. |
| GCC | GCC, or the GNU Compiler Collection, is a suite of compilers developed by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). It includes compilers for various programming languages, with a primary focus on C, C++, and Fortran.
| IDE | An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a comprehensive software application that provides developers with a centralized platform for coding, debugging, testing, and deploying software. It typically includes a source code editor, debugger, build automation tools, and other features to enhance the development workflow. |
| Compiler | A compiler is a software tool that translates high-level source code written in programming languages like C, C++, or Java into machine code or intermediate code. The resulting executable or intermediate code can be run on a computer. Compilers are important in the software development process as they convert human-readable code into a form understandable by computers.|

### 2. Project Overview

The aim of this document is to provide an in depth functional specification for the Virtual Processor Project of Team 7. This project's objective is to develop a virtual processor to execute an assembly-like language. We will virtualize the processor using the C programming language and the GCC compiler.

In our project, we first create an assembly-like language. Then, we bring in the idea of machine code. This code is like the computer's basic language that the CPU directly uses. Our machine code acts as a link between the instructions of our assembly language and the CPU. This step is important because it helps translate the readable assembly-like instructions into the binary language the computer hardware knows. This process allows programs to run effectively on our virtual processor.

### 3. Project Definition

#### ‚û≠ Vision

The fundamental objective of this project is to design and implement a virtual processor capable of executing assembly-like code. This vision revolves around the creation of a minimalistic assembly inspired language specific to the virtual processor, meeting the requirements asked in the call for tender. The assembly-like language thus defined will comprise a series of key instructions, including the storage of immediate values in registers, memory manipulation, basic arithmetic and logic operations, and flow control mechanisms.

#### ‚û≠ Objectives

- Design a minimalist assembly inspired language for the virtual processor, respecting the instructions as asked in the call for tender.
- Implement a C language program capable of reading a text file containing programs written in the defined assembly-like language.
