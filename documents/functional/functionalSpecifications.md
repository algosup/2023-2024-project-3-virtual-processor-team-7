## I. Introduction


### 1. Glossary


| Terms used | Definition |
|---|---|
| Assembler | A program that translates assembly language into machine code. |
| Semantic Validity | Ensuring that the meaning of the assembly code is correct and adheres to the intended functionality. |
| Machine Code | The low-level code that is directly executed by the computer's central processing unit (CPU). |
| Virtual Processor | A virtual processor refers to a simulated or emulated instance of a central processing unit (CPU) that operates in a virtualized environment. It mimics the behavior of a physical processor, allowing the execution of instructions and processing of data, often used for testing, development, or educational purposes. |
| C language | The C programming language is a general-purpose, procedural programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s. It is widely used for system and application software development due to its efficiency, portability, and powerful features. C serves as the foundation for many other programming languages. |
| GCC | GCC, or the GNU Compiler Collection, is a suite of compilers developed by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). It includes compilers for various programming languages, with a primary focus on C, C++, and Fortran. GCC is renowned for its open-source nature, portability, and support for multiple platforms. |
| IDE | An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a comprehensive software application that provides developers with a centralized platform for coding, debugging, testing, and deploying software. It typically includes a source code editor, debugger, build automation tools, and other features to enhance the development workflow. |
| Compiler | A compiler is a software tool that translates high-level source code written in programming languages like C, C++, or Java into machine code or an intermediate code. The resulting executable or intermediate code can be run on a computer. Compilers play a crucial role in the software development process by converting human-readable code into a form understandable by computers. |
