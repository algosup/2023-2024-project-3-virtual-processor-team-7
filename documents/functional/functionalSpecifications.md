### 2. Project Overview

The aim of this document is to furnish a thorough functional specification for the Virtual Processor Project of Team 7. This endeavor encompasses the development of a virtual processor tailored to execute assembly code. The processor will be crafted using the C programming language.

### 3. Project Definition

#### âž­ Vision

The fundamental objective of this project is to design and implement a virtual processor capable of executing assembly code. This vision revolves around the creation of a minimalist assembly language specific to the virtual processor, meeting the requirements defined in the call for tenders. The assembly language thus defined will comprise a series of key instructions, including the storage of immediate values in registers, memory manipulation, basic arithmetic and logic operations, and flow control mechanisms.

#### âž­ Objectives

- Design a minimalist assembly language for the virtual processor, respecting the instructions specified in the call for tenders.
- Implement a C language program capable of reading a text file containing programs written in the defined assembly language.
- Validate the syntax of assembly programs to guarantee their semantic validity.
- Set up virtual system calls to display text in a virtual terminal, enabling visualization of assembly code execution.
- Integrate debugging functions, such as display of register contents, to facilitate the development and verification of assembly code.

#### âž­ Scope

| In Scope |

| Design of a Virtual Processor |
| Minimalist Assembly Language |
| Implementation of an Interpreter |
| Syntax Validation |
| Debugging Features |

| Out of Scope |
|---|
| Compatibility with high-level languages |

| Quality Assurance | Abderrazaq MAKRAN |
| Quality Assurance | RaphaÃ«l PROUDHON |


#### âž­ Project Reviewers

The project evaluators, responsible for the in-depth review and approval of important deliverables, will be the two dedicated Quality Assurance (QA) members of the team. Their role will be to:

- Guarantee the quality of the code, the semantic validity of the assembler programs
- Check that the virtual processor's functionalities meet the criteria specified in the [Functional Requirements](#c-functional-requirements).
