<h2><u><strong>Weekly report project 3: "Virtual processor". Week 1 (8 of january to12 of january).</strong></u>

--------------------------------------------------------
<h3>First steps into the project</h3>


The client gave us a project about a virtual processor and an interpretter which allow us to read and use our own assembly dialect in the processor.

We took a first look at the project individually. Because of time schedule, we weren't able to do a proper meeting this week. 

Since we don't have that much of time this week, we mostly spent our time acquiring the information about :

- Assembly and C language, principaly lines of code and their signification  and how to use it so we don't lose time in project for seeking any information for hours and be more productive.

- Ideas for the fuctional document so we can polish it properly for the deadlyne
