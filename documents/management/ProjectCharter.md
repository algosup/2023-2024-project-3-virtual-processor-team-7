<h3><u>Project : Virtual Processor and Assembly Interpreter</u> </h3>

<H3>Purpose</h3>
The goal of this project is to create A virtual CPU nad an interpreter in C that will read and interpret an assembly language  that we made ourselves.

<h3>Description</h3>
Developp an interpreter for reading our assembly code in our virtual CPU

<h3>Objectives</h3>

- Design a minimalist assembly language for the virtual processor, respecting the instructions as asked in the call for tenders.
- Implement a C language program capable of reading a text file containing programs written in the defined assembly language.
- Validate the syntax of assembly programs to guarantee their semantic validity.
- Set up virtual system calls to display text in a virtual terminal, enabling visualization of assembly code execution.
- Integrate debugging functions, such as display of register contents, to facilitate the development and verification of assembly code
<h3>Project Specification</h3>

-  Make a working Virtual CPU
-  Read and use our own version of Assembly code
