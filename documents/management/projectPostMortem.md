## Succeses

We created our own assembly which had some of the original instructions such as:

- Mathematical and logical operations (like additions, substrations, the AND logical operation...).

- The MOV instruction has also been implemented to assign values to different registers.

To emulate the processor's way of working we implemented a binary conversion to our assembly.

- Communication issues due to frequent absences of some Team mates(sickness or lack of transport)

- Understanding the project properly

- Somme program issues that weren't

## What we learned?


ROBIN : 
 I learned the importance of understanding the project better at the beginning to avoid problem of misunderstanding during the presentation.
I learned also a bit more about how assembly language works but I need to improve my knowledge about that
