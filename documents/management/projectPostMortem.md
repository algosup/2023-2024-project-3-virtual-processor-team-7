## Succeses

We created our own assembly which had some of the original instructions such as:

- Mathematical and logical operations (like additions, substrations, the AND logical operation...).

- The MOV instruction has also been implemented to assign values to different registers.

To emulate the processor's way of working we implemented a binary conversion to our assembly.

## Challenges

Our team had a lot of struggles during the project period such as :

- Communication issues due to frequent absences of some Team mates(sickness or lack of transport).

- Understanding the project properly.

- Somme program issues that weren't fixed for the deadline .

______

## Risk management

To troubleshoot the different risk we had during this project we :

- Casualy had a meeting every morning and every end of the day.

- Had online meeting for people that were absent.

- unit testing.

## What we learned?

| Members | What he learn |
|---|---|
| Mattéo | I learned  a lot on how i should manage a team properly and have a better understanding of the project before starting to work on it. |
| Gaël | I gained insights into the significance of thoroughly understanding the project to prevent misunderstandings later on. I learned the basics of assembly language, but I know I need to get better at it. |
| ROBIN | I learned the importance of understanding the project better at the beginning to avoid problem of misunderstanding during the presentation. I learned also a bit more about how assembly language works but I need to improve my knowledge about that. |
| DAVID |As a software engineer i have now a better grasp and understanding on the intricacies of Assembly as well as the C language.|

In general we have learnt to create a better scope for the project to ensure a satisfying result.
