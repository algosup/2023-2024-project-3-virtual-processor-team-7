<h3>Team Communication</h3>

Our team conducts two weekly meetings every Monday morning and Friday afternoon. The first meeting serves to review the accomplishments of the previous week and plan the objectives for the upcoming week. The primary focus of the second meeting is to recap all the achievements throughout the week.

Additionally, we gather all our progress made in the last quarter of an hour each day. This practice helps enhance the content of our weekly reports on a daily basis.

<h3>Communication with the Client</h3>

We maintain communication with our client through emails or messages using the Slack application. When necessary, we reach out via email or messages to arrange meetings with the client for more in-depth interaction.

This revised format enhances clarity and structure for better readability.
