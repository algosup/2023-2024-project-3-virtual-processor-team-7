<h3>Overview</h3>

<strong>This document will explain in details the main tool we are using to keep track of our project, <u>NOTION.</u></strong>
NOTION is being used as a progress tracker and for documentation storage. It has been splitted in different parts:
A task list, a Gantt chart, a glossary of the programming languages we are going to need (Assembly and C) and finally , a note taking for the functional and technical specifications.
