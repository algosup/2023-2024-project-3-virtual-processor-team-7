<h2><u><strong>Weekly report project 3: "Virtual processor". Week 5 (12th of february to th of february).</strong></u>

------------------------

<h3>Overview</h3>

---
<h3>Achievements</h3>

<h4>Monday and Tuesday</h4>

<h5>program</h5>

We developed a program that enables the reading of binary text files, addressing a critical requirement. This functionality is crucial as our assembly code needs to be converted into binary by our initial program.

<h5>Test Case</h5>

Our team initiated the use of test cases to systematically review the program, ensuring that it aligns with the client's requirements and functions as intended.

<h5>Test Plan</h5>

The test plan is currently undergoing refinement to ensure it's readyness for the deadline.
