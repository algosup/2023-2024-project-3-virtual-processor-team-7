<h2><u><strong>Weekly report project 3: "Virtual processor". Week 3 (22nd of january to 26th of january).</strong></u>

--------------------------------------------
<h3>Overview</h3>
During this week, we principaly focused on the functional specification to create a first prototype of it for wednesday and send it to the client so we can correct or modify it for the final deadline.
<br>
<br>
For this we had to produce a new and functional assembly language, we firstly documented it on the notion all the information about our assembly language (and if we respected all the instruction from the client) and then we replaced it in our functional specification.
<br>
<br>
we also prepared the template for the test plan so the QA's would just have to jump right in the test.

<h5>organisation plan</h5>

On monday, we firstly done a plan of how we organize our represitory :

*The test part of the represitory.*

<h5>The functional</h5>

The functional already have the big lines in the table of content and and a third of the content itself, it just miss sub parts.

*Introduction of the Functional, it include the Glossary, the project overview and definition (including our vision and objectives on this project) and finally, the scope and out of scope of the project.*

<h5>Assembly Program</h5>

Our team started coding by defining in C language the different instructions and different register and initialize the [CPU (Central Processing Unit).](#-glossary)
