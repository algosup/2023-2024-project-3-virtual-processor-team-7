<h2><u><strong>Weekly report project 3: "Virtual processor". Week 3 (22nd of january to 26th of january).</strong></u>

--------------------------------------------
<h3>Overview</h3>
During this week, we principaly focused on the functional specification so we cans send our first prototype of it to the client so we can correct or modify it for the final deadline.
<br>
<br>
For this we had to produce a new and functional assembly language, we firstly documented it on the notion all the information about our assembly language (and if we respected all the instruction from the client) and then we replaced it in our functional specification.
<br>
<br>
we also prepared the template for the test plan so the QA's would just have to jump right in the test.
