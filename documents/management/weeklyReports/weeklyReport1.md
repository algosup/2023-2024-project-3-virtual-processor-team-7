<h2><u><strong>Weekly report project 3: "Virtual processor". Week 1 (8 of january to12 of january).</strong></u>

--------------------------------------------------------
<h3>First steps into the project</h3>

The client gave us a project about a virtual processor and an interpreter which allow us to read and use our own assembly dialect in the processor.

We took a first look at the project individually. Because of time schedule, we weren't able to do a proper meeting this week.

Since we don't have that much time this week, we mostly spent our time acquiring the information about:

- Assembly and C language, principally lines of code and their signification and how to use it so we don't waste time in project to seek any information for hours.

- Ideas for the functional document so we can polish it properly for the deadline
