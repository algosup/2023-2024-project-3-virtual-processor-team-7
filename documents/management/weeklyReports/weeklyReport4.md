<h2><u><strong>Weekly report project 3: "Virtual processor". Week 4 (29th of january to 2nd of february).</strong></u>

--------------------------------------------
<h3>Overview</h3>

We successfully concluded the Functional Specification and  moved our focus towards the Technical Specification, as well as the various tests outlined in the Test Plan.

 Our Quality Assurance team has diligently tested and reviewed all documents and programs, concurrently making progress on the Test Plan.

<h3>Achievements</h3>

<h4>Monday and Tuesday</h4>

<h5>Functional Specification</h5>


The functional specification underwent revisions in the program memory section, which have been meticulously refined, thoroughly reviewed by all the team members, and successfully completed well within the established deadline.

<h5>Technical Specification</h5>

Now that we've wrapped up the Functional phase, we shifted our focus towards the Technical Specification. We created an informative chart outlining the steps for reading, converting our assembly into machine code, and subsequently executing it.

<h3>Project Planning and management</h3>

<h5>KPI'S management </h5>

| KPI's   | Progress |
| -------- | ------- |
| Functional specification  | 100%   |
| Technical specification | 50%   |
| Test Plan| 50%   |
| Assembly-like development | 100%   |
| C language development | 30%  |
| Weekly report  | 60%   |

<h5>Documents rearrangement</h5>

We regrouped all the management documents in a folder named "otherDocuments" in the "mangement"  folder.
<h5>Communication Plan</h5>

We added our team as a stakeholder.

<h5>Critical Path</h5>

We established a critical path to enhance the precision of project duration estimation. This critical path not only identifies crucial activities that must be completed punctually but also sheds light on task dependencies.

<h5>Work Breakdown Structure</h5>

A Work Breakdown Structure has been formulated to organize the project elements systematically in a hierarchical structure.
